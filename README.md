# oracle-scripts

This repository is intended to hold BASH, SQL, and PL/SQL scripts for working with Oracle databases. They may require elevated privileges or non-default object grants, and so will primarily be of interest to DBAs and Developers.

[BASH scripts](bash/BASH.md)

[SQL & PL/SQL scripts](sql/SQL.md)

These scripts have been tested, where applicable, using Oracle 11.2.0.4 and 12.2.0.1. They are expected to run successfully against any 11.2.x and 12.x release.
